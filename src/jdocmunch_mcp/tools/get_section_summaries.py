"""Batch metadata retrieval — companion to v1.38's get_section_summary (v1.48.0).

When an agent has 5+ section_ids from a search and wants full metadata
for each, calling get_section_summary five times is five round-trips.
This tool resolves them in one call against a single load_index().

Per-id errors are reported in-line on the corresponding result entry
rather than aborting the batch — partial failure is preferable to total
failure when an agent is surveying many ids.
