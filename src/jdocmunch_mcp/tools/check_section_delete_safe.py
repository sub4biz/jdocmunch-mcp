"""check_section_delete_safe — composite preflight for section deletion (v1.60.0).

Inspired by jcodemunch-mcp's ``check_delete_safe``. Answers a question
every wiki maintainer asks every week: *can I safely remove this
section?*

Composes four channels into a single verdict + ranked blockers:

  1. **Tutorial-path membership.** Section appears in a Next/Prev chain,
     Sphinx toctree, VuePress sidebar, or ordered-filename sequence —
     deleting it breaks readers walking the tutorial.
  2. **Anchor-specific backlinks.** Other sections link directly to
     ``doc#slug``. Removing the section breaks those anchored links.
  3. **Doc-level backlinks (transitive).** Other sections link to the
     enclosing document; if the section being deleted contains the
     content those references are about, the link still resolves but
     the reader lands on a thinner page. Walked to ``transitive_depth``.
  4. **Recent-edit recency.** The section's source has been edited
     within ``recent_edit_days`` — signals active work that may resume.

Verdict tiers, highest severity first:

  - ``tutorial_path_blocking`` — section is part of an ordered chain
  - ``anchor_referenced`` — direct ``doc#slug`` refs exist
  - ``backlinks_blocking`` — doc-level transitive refs above threshold
  - ``recently_edited_blocking`` — recent activity, defer deletion
  - ``safe_to_delete`` — none of the above

Returns ``{verdict, blockers[≤5], evidence, recommended_action,
_meta}``. Read-only — never mutates the index.
