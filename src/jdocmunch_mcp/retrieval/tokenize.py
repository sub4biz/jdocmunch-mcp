"""Markdown-aware tokenizer for the BM25 engine.

Produces a flat list of lowercase tokens suitable for indexing or scoring:

- Strips fenced code blocks (already excluded by the v1.10.0 parser, but
  we re-scrub here to be defensive about non-parser callers like ad-hoc
  scoring helpers).
- Strips inline backticks but keeps their contents.
- URLs collapse to host + path tokens (so ``https://api.example.com/v2/users``
  yields ``api`` ``example`` ``com`` ``v2`` ``users``).
- Splits on Unicode word boundaries; further splits CamelCase
  (``DocStore`` → ``Doc Store``) and snake_case / kebab-case
  (``embed_query`` → ``embed query``).
- Drops English stop-words and tokens shorter than two characters.

This module has no side effects and no I/O — safe to call from index time
and from query time. Stop-word list is intentionally short; over-aggressive
stop-word removal hurts technical doc retrieval.
